This is to documenet the c structures used in the the overpass-c functions.
Important structures used, not all. I use typedef, so structures can be easly
defined and declared. Below you find structure name : header file

DL_LIST : dList.h
Double linked list.

typedef struct DL_ELEM_ {

    void             *data;
    struct DL_ELEM_  *next;
    struct DL_ELEM_  *prev;

} DL_ELEM;

typedef struct DL_LIST_ {

    int         size;
    void        (*destroy) (void **data); // data is pointer to pointer
    int         (*compare ) (const char *str1, const char *str2);
    DL_ELEM     *head;
    DL_ELEM     *tail;

} DL_LIST;

Main member is DL_ELEM with a pointer to data; the pointer can be to ANY data
type - char string pointer, LINE_INFO pointer. User is responsible to maintain
this pointer, do NOT lose it, AND do not mix pointers.


POINT : overpass-c.h

typedef struct POINT_ {

    double  longitude, latitude;
    int     ns, ew;
    
} POINT;

A point structure with four members, longitude, latitude for GPS identification.
Also two integers named ew and ns; for hundred block numbers, not used yet!
City or county addresses are made out of those numbers.


BBOX : overpass-c.h

typedef struct BBOX_ {

    POINT   sw, ne;
    
} BBOX;

The bounding box, defined by 2 points, sw (south-west) and ne (north-east).

XROADS : overpass-c.h

typedef struct XROADS_ {

    char    *firstRD, *secondRD;
    POINT   point;
    int     nodesFound;
    GPS_PT  *nodesGPS[];

} XROADS;

Cross roads structure. Intersection of 2 streets / roads.

DIMENSION : mkWKT.h

typedef struct DIMENSION_ {

    int	row, col;

} DIMENSION;

Two integers; row and column for 2 dimensional array.

XRDS_MTRX : mkWKT.h

typedef struct XRDS_MTRX_ {

    DIMENSION   dim;
    XROADS      **xrds;

}XRDS_MTRX;

Cross roads matrix or array, with DIMENSION member and a pointer to pointer to
XROADS structures or the 2 dimensional array itself.

RECT_MTRX : mkWKT.h

typedef struct RECT_MTRX_ {

    DIMENSION   dim;
    RECTANGLE   **rect;

} RECT_MTRX;


A 2 dimensional array of RECTANGLES; 
just like XRDS_MTRX above but for RECTANGLES.
