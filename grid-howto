Input file preparation:

Input file is a text file. It is expected to have values for a bounding box and
street names and the number of rectangles to make out of those street names.
Street names can be listed one after another [Four Corners] or in [row X column]
fashion with at least 2 rows and 2 columns so the program can make four corners
rectangle.

Best tools you can use are a pen or pencil, few sheets of paper and a text editor.

The bounding box is defined by two points, namely: 
South-West (sw) point and North-East (ne) point specified in decimal degrees
listed with (latitude, longitude) order.
"sw-latitude, sw-longitude, ne-latitude, ne-longitude"

On a sheet of paper draw a rectangle for bounding box, the south-west point is
the lower-left corner of the rectangle, north-east point is the upper-right
corner of the rectangle. The bounding box need to enclose all intersections in
the grid, no more. No need to make it too big. The GPS point can be found in any
map display program; to name few : google map, open street map, marble or QGIS.
Make sure the GPS is in "Decimal Degree" format (decimal number).
In most of these programs you can copy the GPS to the clipboard. Usually this
GPS point is formatted with (longitude, latitude) order and what we need here is
to reverse this order to (latitude, longitude) format. Write down the south-west
point and then the north-east point on one line with each decimal number separated
by a comma. This will be the bounding box line in the input file.

Street names can provided in two different ways. First as a road intersection
with two street names on a line. In this case you need four intersections for
each rectangle. Draw a rectangle on a sheet of paper and name your corners with
street names, moving clockwise from the lower-left corner (south-west) start
writing corners one per line:
south-west cross road
north-west cross road
north-east cross road
south-east cross road

Follow the same procedure for the other rectangles and list them one after the 
other using the same clockwise movement around each one, be consistent in this
movement.
The first line in this [Four corner] format is the number of rectangles, so if
you list six rectangles write the single digit number '6' on the first line.

The second way street names can provided is the [Row X Column] format. This
format assumes roads to run in fairly straight lines, Phoenix, Arizona is laid
out in a grid system where this format works great to draw a grid over the map.
In this format we need at least 2 horizontal roads and 2 vertical roads to make
one rectangle. To list horizontal roads we move from south to north, and to list
vertical roads we move west to east, we list one street / road name per line.
From your map start from the sothern most part and moving north (UP) start your
listing of the horizontal roads, writing one name after the other in your text
input file until you list all horizontal roads. Follow that with names of your
vertical roads starting from the west (left side of the map) to the east (right
side of the map).

The first line is the number of rectangles in [Row x Column] format, without 
the brackets. Write how many rows you listed followed by any single character
from the set [Xx*] followed by the number of columns you listed.

How to use the output:

The program produces a text in Well Known Text format for polygons. This text
can be used with QGIS to draw the grid. The program by default writes it output
to the screen, use the output option (-o or --output) followed by file name to
save that output to a disk file. QGIS expects to find "Delimited Text" in files
ending with ".csv" or Comma Separated Values, the program will append this 
extension to file name if you did not include any extension only, otherwise it
does nothing to file name. An example of program output:

wkt;
"POLYGON ((-112.0564484 33.4586782, -112.0564715 33.4729761, -112.0389638 33.4729638, -112.0390102 33.4586488, -112.0564484 33.4586782))"
"POLYGON ((-112.0564715 33.4729761, -112.0563754 33.4874327, -112.0388972 33.4875282, -112.0389638 33.4729638, -112.0564715 33.4729761))"
"POLYGON ((-112.0390102 33.4586488, -112.0388972 33.4875282, -112.0042227 33.4878275,   0.0000000  0.0000000, -112.0390102 33.4586488))"

The above output is from input file "roos36.grid" from the examples directory.
Note there is a point with "0.0000000  0.0000000" values on the third line.
That was a missing value, QGIS will not accept files with "missing values". The
program will inform you when it can not find GPS for intersection from Overpass
server with the intersection street names. In this case it outputs those lines:

mk-grid: Could not get GPS for some cross roads! Please see list below.

North 36Th Street, East Roosevelt Street

When looking at the map for Phoenix, Arizona we find Roosevelt Street does NOT
meet 36Th Street. To use the above output, you can delete the last line and
only draw two polygons. Or you can manually edit the output at that point to
values of where it should be by copying the GPS from any map display program
making sure to use the same format as above. The edited output is below with
GPS value of "-112.00407  33.45857" replacing the "0.0000000  0.0000000"

wkt;
"POLYGON ((-112.0564484 33.4586782, -112.0564715 33.4729761, -112.0389638 33.4729638, -112.0390102 33.4586488, -112.0564484 33.4586782))"
"POLYGON ((-112.0564715 33.4729761, -112.0563754 33.4874327, -112.0388972 33.4875282, -112.0389638 33.4729638, -112.0564715 33.4729761))"
"POLYGON ((-112.0390102 33.4586488, -112.0388972 33.4875282, -112.0042227 33.4878275,  -112.00407  33.45857, -112.0390102 33.4586488))"

Note that the above example file has [Four Corner] rectangles, they do not need
to be the same size (dimension), or have a common border, they just need to be
rectangles to have a grid, you can also have funny looking four corner shapes!

Another example file provided is the "big.grid" file, this input file has type
[Row X column] where street names are listed in row and column order.

The one input file can not have mixed format of [Four Corner] and [Row X Column],
but you can use 2 input files with different files format in one invocation or
one session. The result will be one combined list of the two (or more) files.
The combined list can be used to add a layer with QGIS. Try it with the examples
in one command:

mk-grid -o combined examples/roos36.grid examples/big.grid

The above command will produce file "combined.csv" in $HOME/mk-grid directory.
Open the output file and correct the missing GPS point, then you be able to add
a layer in QGIS using that file.

The "pictures" directory has few screen shoots for the examples with that of the 
same file name and the combined picture of the two from the command above. Note
that the layer settings I changed were the "Fill Color" to transparent and the
stroke fill width was increased.
